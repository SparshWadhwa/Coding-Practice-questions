##Sum of two numbers is given and LCM and HCF is given. Find sum of reciprocals

Way to solve Type 1 Questions

Let numbers be a and b. So a + b is given. 

You know LCM x HCF = product of two numbers i.e. a x b is also given

So 1/a + 1/b = (a + b)/(a x b)

Example. If the sum of two numbers is 55 and the H.C.F. and L.C.M of these numbers are 5 and 120 respectively, then the sum of the reciprocals of the numbers is equal to

with this direct formula answer is 55/(5Ã—120) = 11/120

Now this question can be iterated. Where some times LCM, product and sum is given but not HCF or other permutations of the same.

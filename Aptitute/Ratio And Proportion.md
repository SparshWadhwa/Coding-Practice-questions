### 1. Ratio
A ratio is simply a fraction. The following notations all express the ratio of x to y

=> x:y , x÷y , or x/y.

In the ratio x:y, we call a as the first term or antecedent and b, the second term or consequent.

Writing two numbers as a ratio provides a convenient way to compare their sizes. For example, since 3π<1, we know that 3 is less than π .

A ratio compares two numbers. Just as you cannot compare apples and oranges, so the numbers you are comparing must have the same units.

For example, you cannot form the ratio of 2 feet to 4 meters because the two numbers are expressed in different units - feet vs. meters.

### 2. Proportion
The equality of two ratios (fractions) is called proportion. If a : b = c : d, we write a : b :: c : d and we say that a, b, c, d are in proportion.

Here a and d are called extremes, while b and c are called mean terms.

Product of means=Product of extremes
Thus,
a:b::c:d⟺(b∗c)=(a∗d)

## 2.1 Fourth Proportional
If a:b=c:d, then d is called the fourth proportional to a,b,c.


## 2.2 Third Proportional
a:b=c:d, then c is called the third proportional to a and b.


## 2.3 Mean Proportional
Mean proportional between a and b is ab.
## 2.4 Comparison of Ratios
We say that (a:b)>(c:d)\Longleftrightarrowab>cd

2.5 Compounded Ratio
The compounded ratio of the ratios: (a:b),(c:d),(e:f) is (ace:bdf)

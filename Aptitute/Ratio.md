### 1. Ratio
A ratio is simply a fraction. The following notations all express the ratio of x to y

=> x:y , x÷y , or x/y.

In the ratio x:y, we call a as the first term or antecedent and b, the second term or consequent.

Writing two numbers as a ratio provides a convenient way to compare their sizes. For example, since 3π<1, we know that 3 is less than π .

A ratio compares two numbers. Just as you cannot compare apples and oranges, so the numbers you are comparing must have the same units.

For example, you cannot form the ratio of 2 feet to 4 meters because the two numbers are expressed in different units - feet vs. meters.
